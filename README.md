# Data-literacy-project
By using the Economistâ€™s excess death tracker we want to see how well excess death can be predicted from indexes such as HDI, obesity, age distribution, confirmed COVID-related deaths, economic strength

The data for the excess death are from 25 different countries, mentioned below and the HDI, obesity, age distribution and economic strength data are to be found and cleaned up for analyses

The countries include:
austria, belgium, bolivia, brazil, britain, chile, colombia, ecuador, france, germany, indonesia, israel, italy, mexico, netherlands, norway, peru, portugal, russia, south-africa, spain, sweden, switzerland, turkey and US.
